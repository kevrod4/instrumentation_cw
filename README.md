# Instrumentation Coursework

This is a group project completed by Ellis Collins and Kevin Rodrigues as a part of a coursework for the Instrumentation Module during the Winter Semester of 2021.

The objective of this coursework is to design a Complex Impedance Meter from scratch and implement it on a PCB and finally interface it with a Nucleo-F446RE microcontroller.

The code for the STM32CubeIDE project is provided in this repository along with the configuration file. The Reports folder contains the reports submitted for the coursework.
